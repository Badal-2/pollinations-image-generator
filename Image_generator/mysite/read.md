We are using of   __Pollinations.ai__ model  in our project. it's totally free to Generating Images by Prompt. 
__Pollination.ai__  It Generates Images NOT Fetching From Google Internet







✅ __WORK__

our Prompt: "Dog"
        ↓
Pollinations.ai API
        ↓
AI Model (e.g., Stable Diffusion)
        ↓
Neural Network processes:
  - Understands "Dog" concept
  - Generates pixels from noise
  - Creates brand NEW image
        ↓
Unique Dog Image (never existed befo)



✅ __Summary__

1) Yes, there's an AI model (like an LLM, but for images)
2) It GENERATES images from scratch using neural networks
3) NOT fetching from Google/databases
4)
